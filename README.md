Setup (Mac OS):

1. Navigate to the folder and use the first rule of the Makefile:
	$>make
2. Run the fdf executable followed by a map of your choice (serveral inculded in the maps folder). E.g.:
	$>./fdf maps/42.fdf
3. Use 'R', 'G' and 'B' of your keybord to add more Red, Green or Blue. 'T', 'H' and N will decrease the those color values.
Press 'return' to have a 'realistic' mode for maps like france.fdf.
Also try '1' until 9 of your keybord for rotations.
'+' and '-' for the zoom, and '/' '*' to modify the 'z' attribute (height) of the map.

Enjoy
